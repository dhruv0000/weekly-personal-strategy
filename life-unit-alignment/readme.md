# Strategic Life Portfolio

This repository contains a script to generate a visual representation of one's strategic life portfolio, inspired by the principles outlined in the Harvard Business Review article ["Use Strategic Thinking to Create the Life You Want"](https://hbr.org/2023/12/use-strategic-thinking-to-create-the-life-you-want).

## Overview

The strategic life portfolio is a tool that helps individuals align their time and energy with what is truly important to them. By rating various aspects of life on importance, satisfaction, and time invested, one can visualize and strategize for a more fulfilling life.

## How It Works

The `main.py` script reads input from an `input.md` file where you can define the Strategic Life Units (SLUs) along with their importance, satisfaction, and time invested values. The script generates a bubble chart, with the radius of each bubble proportional to the time invested in each SLU.

## Preparing Your SLUs

Edit the `input.md` file to reflect your current strategic life units. Keep the format as is. You can add/delete your own feilds.
